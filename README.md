In recent years, the exponential growth of spatiotemporal data has led to an increasing need for new interactive methods for accessing and analyzing this data. In the biodiversity domain, species co-occurrence models are critical to gain a mechanistic understanding of the processes underlying biodiversity and supporting its maintenance. This paper introduces a new framework that allows users to explore species occurrences datasets at different spatial and temporal periods to extract co-occurrence patterns. As a real-world case study, we conducted several experiments on a subset of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) occurrences dataset to extract species co-occurrence patterns interactively. For better understanding, these co-occurrence patterns are visualized in a map view and as a graph. Also, the user can export these patterns in CSV format for further use. For many queries, runtimes are in a range that allows for interaction already. Further optimizations are on our research agenda.
